# Task App

This is a task management application developed for Android using Kotlin and Firebase. 
It allows users to create, update the status, and delete tasks. 
The application utilizes RecyclerView to display the list of tasks and consists of multiple activities and XML files.

This application has been made mainly to practice my knowledge. It is not published.

## Features

- **Firebase Integration:** The application uses Firebase to store and manage tasks. Make sure to have your project configured in Firebase and include the `google-services.json` configuration file in the `app` folder of your project.

- **Create Tasks:** Users can add new tasks through the provided user interface.

- **Update Status:** Tasks can be marked as completed or in progress, and the application automatically updates the status in Firebase.

- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.

- **RecyclerView:** The task list is displayed using a RecyclerView for a smooth user experience.
